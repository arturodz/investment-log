The first thing I do when I am looking for investment opportunities is to start up my stock screener. My main requirement is access to securities in global markets. There are a few screeners that meet this requirement but the best I've found are the [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance#stockscreener) Screener (free)  and [Screener.co](http://screener.co) which is well worth the small monthly fee they charge.
